# AlphaExaAI Strategic Roadmap

## 🏁 Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
*   [x] Conceptualization of 250B MoE Architecture.
*   [x] Initial Tokenizer development.
*   [x] Basic codebase structure.

## 🚀 Phase 2: The "Agentic Awakening" (Current)
*   [ ] **Data Pipeline Integration:** Connect with `ExaAiAgent` to ingest real-world problem-solving logs.
*   [ ] **Efficiency Upgrade:** Implement `Unsloth` and `FlashAttention-3` kernels to reduce training overhead by 40%.
*   [ ] **Context Extension:** Upgrade RoPE scaling to support **2M+ tokens**.
*   [ ] **Multimodal Modules:** Integrate vision encoders/decoders.

## 🌩️ Phase 3: The "Forge" (Training)
