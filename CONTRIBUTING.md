# Contributing to AlphaExaAI

We are building the world's most powerful open-source agentic model. This is not a typical open-source project; it involves high-performance computing (HPC), advanced ML engineering, and rigorous scientific standards.

## 🔬 Areas of Contribution

We actively welcome contributions in the following areas:

1.  **Dataset Curation (The "Fuel"):**
    *   High-quality code datasets (Python, Rust, C++).
    *   Mathematical proofs and physics simulations.
    *   *Agentic Trajectories:* Logs of AI agents solving complex tasks (e.g., from ExaAiAgent).

2.  **Model Architecture (The "Engine"):**
    *   Optimizations for FlashAttention-3.
    *   Improvements to MoE routing logic.
    *   Quantization techniques (4-bit/8-bit) for efficient inference.

3.  **Evaluation & Benchmarking:**
    *   Designing tough tests for "reasoning" and "planning" (not just multiple choice).
    *   Red-teaming for security and safety.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

Please ensure you have access to a CUDA-capable environment.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/hleliofficiel/AlphaExaAI.git
cd AlphaExaAI

# Install dependencies (optimized for efficiency)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📜 Code Standards

*   **Python:** Black formatting required.
*   **Documentation:** All major functions must have docstrings explaining the mathematical logic.
*   **Testing:** New modules must include unit tests.

## 🤝 Community Guidelines

*   Be respectful and constructive.
*   Focus on scientific accuracy.
*   Innovation over imitation.
